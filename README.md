- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JayJayArr, you might know me as Jakob
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust in production ðŸ¦€ and CI/CD, there is always something to learn.
- ðŸ”§ I am open to projects which need contributions, preferrably using Rust.
- I would be especially fond of mentoring, regarding best practices and already existing experiences in backend development.
